```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Name TBD
I will think of a cool name later.  

## Introduction  

**DATA**

Here I will discuss the data set I will be using for my final projects Analysis.

I will have embedded R chunks like this one which will show exactly what kind of data I will be using.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

##Plots

there will also be plots because who doesnt like well formated plots?  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Stay tuned!
